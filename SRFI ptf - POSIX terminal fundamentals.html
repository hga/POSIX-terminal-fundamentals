<p>
by John Cowan (architect and author) and Harold Ancell (author and editor)
</p>


<h2>Status</h2>



<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Procedures to support safely changing terminal modes, such as cooked
to raw, for command line and terminal interface programs, and serial
line device manipulation for embedded and the like hardware
interfacing.
</p>


<h2>Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>
How to prescribe and/or enforce safe use of <code>with-cooked-mode</code>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Whether to include serial line procedures in this, or a seperate SRFI.
</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Rationale</h2>

??? detailed rationale.  This should be 200-500 words long.  Please
explain why the proposal should be incorporated as a standard feature
in Scheme implementations.  List related standards and SRFIs,
including dependencies, conflicts, and replacements.  If there are
other standards which this proposal will replace or with which it will
compete, please explain why the present proposal is a substantial
improvement.

<p>
P<small>OSIX</small> provides a complete set of routines for
manipulating terminal devices &mdash; putting them in "raw" mode,
changing and querying their special characters, modifying their I/O
speeds, and so forth.
Now that terminal emulators have almost completely displaced
terminals, very little of this is useful except for directly
controlling serial-line hardware, which is still widely used for
embedded programming and applications.
</p>
<p>
This SRFI provides safe high level wrappers for using raw, no echo
etc. terminal modes. for use by command-line programs and texual user
interfaces, and relevant serial line manipulation procedures such as
setting the baud rate.
</p>
<p>
These two disparate use cases are bundled together in one SRFI because
the complicated low level infrastructure for implementing either is
roughtly the same, except for different sets of constants, which are
presumebly cheap to impliment.
</p>
<p>
The one SRFI 170 terminal function left.  Mention this is a spin-off of
it?
</p>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<h4>Miscellaneous procedures</h4>

<!--<code>(foreign-error? <i>object</i>)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>boolean</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)
<blockquote>
<p>
Returns #f unless <i>object</i> is a SRFI 198 error.
</p>
<pre class="example">
(foreign-error? "This is not an foreign error object") &rArr; #f
(foreign-error? (make-foreign-error &lt;valid-alist&gt;)) &rArr; #t
</pre>
</blockquote> -->

<code>(terminal-file-name <i>port</i>)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>boolean</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>ttyname()</code>
<blockquote>
<p>
The argument <i>port</i> must be open on a terminal.
Returns the file name of the terminal.
</p>
<pre class="example">
(terminal-file-name &lt;~~~FIX_ME&gt;) &rArr; ~~~FIX_ME
(terminal-file-name &lt;~~~FIX_ME&gt;) &rArr; ~~~FIX_ME
</pre>
</blockquote>


<h4>Serial line manipulation</h4>

<h4>Safe terminal I/O primitives</h4>

<p>
The following procedures use <code>dynamic-wind</code> when executing
their <code><i>proc</i></code> procedure argument.
If <i><code>proc</code>'s</i> dynamic extent is escaped, the terminal
mode changes of the containing <code>with-</code>
or <code>without-</code> procedure are undone, but if
<i><code>proc</code>'s</i> dynamic extent is re-entered, the terminal
mode changes of the containing procedure are restored to their
previous state.  They all use P<small>OSIX</small>
<code>tcgetattr()</code> and <code>tcsetattr()</code>; see also
the <code>stty</code> command.
</p>

<p>
The general paradigm for using <code>with-raw-mode</code>
and <code>with-rare-mode</code> is to set up your application, then
run it in the <code><i>proc</i></code> provided to them, a procedure
that takes the same port arguments in the same order as the
containing <code>with-</code> or <code>without-</code> procedure.
When inside <code><i>proc</i></code>, <code>with-cooked-mode</code>
can be used for a termporarily escape, for instance to a shell.
The <code>without-echo</code> procedure is an exception in that it's
generally used to enter a password or passphrase.  The procedures
return the values that <code><i>proc</i></code> returns.
</p>

<code>(with-raw-mode <i>input-port output-port min time proc</i>)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>[values]</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>stty -ECHO -ICANON -IEXTEN -ISIG -BRKINT -ICRNL -INPCK -ISTRIP -IXON -CSIZE -PARENB CS8 -OPOST VMIN=<i>min</i> VTIME=<i>time</i></code>
<blockquote>
<p>
The port arguments must be opened on a terminal.
The terminal is set to raw mode during the dynamic execution of <code>proc</code>
and then is restored to canonical "cooked" mode.
The effect of the <i>min</i> and <i>time</i> arguments is that any
reads done on the terminal while raw mode is in effect will return to
the caller after <i>min</i> bytes have been read or <i>time</i>
deciseconds (1/10ths of a second) have elapsed, whichever comes first.
Therefore, it makes no sense to use any read operation on the terminal
except <code>read-char</code> or <code>read-string</code>,
which read a fixed number of characters.
No character is given special handling; all are passed to the
application exactly as received.
Echoing of input is disabled on the terminal during the execution
of <code>proc</code>.

<blockquote>
<p>
The port arguments must be opened on a terminal.
The terminal is set to "rare", also known as cbreak mode during the
dynamic execution of <code>proc</code>, and then is restored to
canonical "cooked" mode.
Just as in canonical mode, any read operation on the terminal
will wait until characters are received, unlike raw mode.
However, no characters are given special interpretation except
the characters that send signals (by default, Ctrl-C and Ctrl-\).
Echoing of input is disabled on the terminal during the execution
of <code>proc</code>.

<blockquote>
<p>
The port arguments must be opened on a terminal.
The terminal is set to canonical "cooked" during the dynamic execution
of <code>proc</code>, and then is restored to the previous mode.
In canonical mode, any read operation on the terminal will wait until
characters are received, and no characters are given special
interpretation.
The characters that send signals (by default, Ctrl-C and Ctrl-\) may
well terminate the instance of Scheme you are using, so it is wise to
quickly switch to a subprocess such as a shell.

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>
John Cowan conceived the <code>with-*</code>
and <code>without-echo</code> procedures, particularly their operating
paradigm which minimizes the classic risk of leaving a terminal in an
odd, often non-echoing state.
