<h2>Status</h2>



<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
A set of procedures to support command line and terminal interface
programs, and serial interfaces to embedded and the like hardware.
</p>


<h2>Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>
Whether to include with-cooked-mode, including how safely it can be
done.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Whether to include serial line procedures in this or a seperate SRFI.
</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Rationale</h2>

??? detailed rationale.  This should be 200-500 words long.  Please
explain why the proposal should be incorporated as a standard feature
in Scheme implementations.  List related standards and SRFIs,
including dependencies, conflicts, and replacements.  If there are
other standards which this proposal will replace or with which it will
compete, please explain why the present proposal is a substantial
improvement.


P<small>OSIX</small> provides a complete set of routines for
manipulating terminal devices &mdash; putting them in "raw" mode,
changing and querying their special characters, modifying their I/O
speeds, and so forth.  However, now that terminal emulators have
almost completely displaced terminals, very little of this is useful
except for directly controlling serial-line hardware, which is still
widely used for embedded programming.  This SRFI provides useful
serial line procedures, and high level safe wrapper for use by
command-line programs.

Once you go to the trouble of implementing the with-* and without-echo
procedures, including serial terminal control ones is not much extra
work given Chibi Scheme sample implementation provided.

The one SRFI 170 terminal function left.  Mention this is a spin-off of
it?


<h2>Specification</h2>



<h2>Implementation</h2>



<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>
John Cowan conceived the with-* and without-echo procedures,
particularly their operating paradigm which minimizes the risk of
leaving a terminal in an odd, often non-echoing state.
